<h2>Verification Framework Description<br>
</h2>
For high level requirement R-T6, the Runtime Monitor should check whether the car 
stops at floors that have no pending calls. The monitor shall throw a warning every 
time the motor was commanded to stop while there are not pending calls at CurrentFloor. 
The states colored in green are valid, while the one colored in red is invalid. 
If the elevator enters an invalid state, then the monitor should throw a warning. 
The statechart for high level requirement R-T6 is: <br>

</div>
<br>
For high level requirement R-T7, the Runtime Monitor should check whether the car 
opens Doors at Hallways that have no pending calls. The monitor shall throw a warning every 
time the Doormotors at hallway b were commanded to open while there are not pending calls at CurrentFloor, 
hallway b. 
The states colored in green are valid, while the one colored in red is invalid. 
If the elevator enters an invalid state, then the monitor should throw a warning.

For high-level requirement RT8-1:
At first, the monitor is in “Lantern Off” state. 
1. If door is not closed and there are pending calls at other floors. The car lantern will be turn on based on the target floor compared with current floor. This is the correct implementation.
2. If door is not closed and there are no pending calls at other floors. If the car lantern is turn on, then this is the wrong implementation. The monitor should show some warnings to the tester.

</div>
<br>
For high-level requirement RT8-2:
At first, the monitor is in “Lantern Off” state.
1. If door is opening and Desired Direction is up, it means the car will keep going up after it stops at this floor. So lantern[up] is on. In this case, if lantern[down] is turned on before door closed. Then it is a wrong implementation.
2. If door is opening and Desired Direction is down, it means the car will keep going down after it stops at this floor. So lantern[down] is on. In this case, if lantern[up] is turned on before door closed. Then it is a wrong implementation.

</div>
<br>
For high-level requirement RT8-3:
At first, the monitor is in “Lantern Off” state.
1. If door is opening and Desired Direction is up, it means the car will keep going up after it stops at this floor. So If the target floor is smaller or equal to current floor, then it means the car lantern indicates the wrong direction. So the implementation is wrong.
2. If door is opening and Desired Direction is down, it means the car will keep going down after it stops at this floor. So If the target floor is larger or equal to current floor, then it means the car lantern indicates the wrong direction. So the implementation is wrong.

<br>
For high-level requirement RT9, the invalid state is the car is moving too slow when it's supposed to be moving faster. The car will travel about 0.04m after leaving a certain floor and moving in slow speed. Thus, if the car speed is less than 0.25m/s under the condition that mCarLevelPosition is still quite far away from desired floor (e.g. more than 1 meter), it is moving too slow and a warning should be issued.

</div>

<br>
For RT-10, doors are only commanded to nudge after door reversal is triggered before. Thus, the invalid state would happen when doors are commanded to nudge when no door reversal triggered before.
